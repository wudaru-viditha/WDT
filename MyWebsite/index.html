        <p>Technically, “Some data are missing.” is correct because “data” is the plural of “datum”, which means a piece of information. So several pieces of information (datum) are called data.
          An analogy is “people” which is the plural of “person”. “This person is missing.” “These people are missing.”
          It has become popular to say “Data is missing,” which could be considered correct if “data” was considered a single group of datum(s). So, “(The group of) data is missing.” is also correct from this perspective.
